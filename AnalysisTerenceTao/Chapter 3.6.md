##### Exercise 3.6.1
- We can easily see that the bijection $f:X\to X$ exists as it is the identity function thus the sets $X$ and $X$ have the same cardinality. 
- Since we already know that the bijective function $f:X\to Y$ exists and since it is a bijective function from the definition of inverse functions we can see that the bijective function $f^{-1}:Y\to X$ also exists thus showing that if $X$ has equal cardinality with $Y$ then $Y$ has equal cardinality with $X$.
- We know that the bijective function $f:X\to Y$ and the bijective function $g:Y\to Z$ exists. Since both $f$ and $g$ are bijective we also know that the function $g\circ f$ is also bijective by [[Chapter 3.3#Exercise 3.3.2]] thus completing the proof.
