##### Exercise 3.4.1
Let $f: X \to Y$ be a bijective function, $f^{-1}$ be its inverse function and $V$ be any subset of $Y$.
By their definition the forward image of $V$ under $f^{-1}$ is the set $\{f^{-1}(y): y\in V\}$ and the inverse image of $V$ under $f$ is the set $\{x\in X : f(x) \in V\}$. We already know that by the definition of inverse functions that the domain of $f^{-1}$ is the set $X$ thus the sets $\{f^{-1}(y) \in X:y\in V\}$ and $\{f^{-1}(y): y\in V\}$ are the same set. Since $f$ is a bijective function we know that there exists an $x$ for every $y \in Y$ such that $y = f(x)$ and $f^{-1}(y) = x$ thus we can see that the set $\{f^{-1}(y) \in X:y\in V\}$ and the set $\{x\in X : f(x) \in V\}$ are equivalent by axiom of replacement.
##### Exercise 3.4.2
Since we know that every element of $S$ is also an element of $X$, we know that the image $f(S)$ contains an element $f(x)$ for every element $x\in S$ thus $f^{-1}(f(S))$ must contain every element of $S$. If $f$ is not injective then there can be elements $y \in f(S)$ where $f(x) = y\text{ and } x \notin S$ because for an object $y \in Y$ there can be more than one $x\in X$ where $f(x) = y$ by the definition of functions, thus $f^{-1}(f(S))$ may contain elements that are not an element of $S$ from the definition of inverse images. We can always say that $S \subseteq f^{-1}(f(S))$. If f is injective then for every $y \in Y$ there exists a single $x \in X$ where $f(x) = y$ thus $f^{-1}(f(S))$ can only contain elements that are in the set $S$ or we can say that $f^{-1}(f(S)) \subseteq S$. This is equivalent to saying that if $f$ is injective then $S = f^{-1}(f(S))$.
From the definition of images we know that $f^{-1}(U) = \{x\in X: f(x) \in U\}$ and $f(f^{-1}(U)) = \{f(a) : a\in\{x \in X:f(x)\in U\}\}$, we also know from axiom of replacement that $a\in\{x \in X:f(x)\in U\} \iff (a\in X \text{ and } f(a) \in U)$ thus we can say that $f(f^{-1}(U)) = \{f(a) : a\in X \text{ and } f(a) \in U\}$. We can see that $f(f^{-1}(U)) \subseteq U$ and because all of its elements must be mapped using the function $f$ we can say that $f(f^{-1}(U)) \subseteq f(X)$ or in other words by the definition of intersection $f(f^{-1}(U)) = U\cap f(X)$. 
If $f$ is surjective then $f(X) = Y$ and since we know that $U\subseteq Y$ this means we can say that $U\cap f(X) = U$ which in turn means that if $f$ is surjective then $f(f^{-1}(U)) = U$. 
##### Exercise 3.4.3
By the definition of images we know that $f(A\cup B) = \{f(x):x\in A\cup B\}$, and by the axiom of specification we can see that $y\in f(A\cup B)\iff(y=f(x)\text{ and }x\in A\cup B)$. Using the axiom of pairwise union we can say that $(y=f(x)\text{ and }(x\in A\text{ or }x\in B)$ which is equivalent to $(y=f(x_1)\text{ and }x_1\in A) \text{ or } (y=f(x_2)\text{ and }x_2\in B)$. Using the axiom of specification and the definition of images we can say this statement is equivalent to $y\in f(A)\text{ or }y\in f(B)$ and by the axiom of pairwise union this is the same as $y\in (f(A)\cup f(B))$, thus we can see that $y\in f(A\cup B) \iff y\in(f(A)\cup f(B))$, and by definition if set equality $f(A\cup B) = f(A)\cup f(B)$.

Using a similar argument and the definition of pairwise intersection we can say that $y\in f(A\cap B) \iff (y=f(x)\text{ and }x\in A \text{ and } x\in B)$ and $y\in (f(A)\cap f(B))\iff((y=f(a)\text{ and }a\in A) \text{ and } (y=f(b)\text{ and }b\in B))$. 
We can see that $(y=f(x)\text{ and }x\in A \text{ and } x\in B)\implies((y=f(a)\text{ and }a\in A) \text{ and } (y=f(b)\text{ and }b\in B))$ but not vice versa because there can be objects $a\in A$ and $b \in B$ such that $f(a) = f(b) \text{ and } a \neq b$, thus by definition of subsets $f(A\cap B) \subseteq f(A)\cap f(B)$. These two sets are only equal on the specific case of the function $f$ being injective as that would mean there cannot be two objects that satisfy the condition $((y=f(a)\text{ and }a\in A) \text{ and } (y=f(b)\text{ and }b\in B))$.

Using a similar argument we can see that this is also the case for the sets $f(A)\setminus f(B)$ and $f(A\setminus B)$.
##### Exercise 3.4.4
We can use the same arguments in [[#Exercise 3.4.3]] to show that everything works the same way for inverse images except for one thing. Since we know that for $f(x)$ there must be a single unique object mapped in the range $Y$ we don't need to require the function to be injective to show that the sets are equal. $f$ being a function is enough of a restriction.
##### Exercise 3.4.5
Look at [[#Exercise 3.4.2]].
##### Exercise 3.4.6
Let $X$ be a set, by axiom 3.10 we know that the power set $\{0, 1\}^X$ also exists. Since all the objects in this power set must be a function every object in $X$ is mapped to either $0$ or $1$. For every subset of $X$ we can say that a function in the set $\{0,1\}^X$ exists such that the elements that are in the subset are mapped to $1$ and the elements that are not in the subset are mapped to $0$. Using the axiom of replacement, we can replace every function $f$ in the power set $\{0,1\}^X$ with $f^{-1}(\{1\})$ and this would correspond to every subset as I have stated. Thus we know that the set $\{Y: Y\subseteq X\}$ is a set.
##### Exercise 3.4.7
Let $X$ and $Y$ be sets and $2^X$ and $2^Y$ be the power set of $X$ and $Y$ respectively. Let A be any set and by the axiom of replacement we can replace every element $Y'\in 2^Y$ with the set of functions $Y'^A$ and call this set B. Using the the axiom of union we can see that the set $\bigcup B$ is a set and is the set of all partial functions whose domain is A and range is a subset of Y. We'll say that the function $g(A)$ maps the set $A$ to this new set of functions $\bigcup B$. 
By the axiom of replacement we can replace every element $X' \in 2^X$ with the set of functions $g(X')$ and we'll call this set $C$. Using the axiom of union we can see that the set $\bigcup C$ is a set and is the set of all partial functions whose domain is a subset of X and range is a subset of Y thus completing the proof.
##### Exercise 3.4.8
We need to show that given any two sets $A$, $B$ there exists a set $A\cup B$ such that $x \in A\cup B \iff (x\in A \text{ or } x\in B)$.
From the axiom of pair sets we know that the set $C = \{A, B\}$ exists. Since all of this set's elements are sets we can also say that by the axiom of union the set $\bigcup C$ exists such that $x \in \bigcup C \iff (x\in S \text{ for some } S\in C)$. Since we know all the elements of $C$ we can rewrite this as $x\in \bigcup C \iff (x \in A \text{ or } x\in B)$ thus completing the proof.
##### Exercise 3.4.9
First let's inspect the set $\{x\in A_\beta:x\in A_\alpha\text{ for all }\alpha\in I\}$. Since we know that $\beta'\in I$, by axiom of specification we can say that $y\in\{x\in A_\beta:x\in A_\alpha\text{ for all }\alpha\in I\} \iff (y\in A_\beta \text{ and } y\in A_{\beta'} \text{ and } y\in A_\alpha \text{ for all } \alpha\in I)$ 
and by following a similar logic we can also say that $y\in\{x\in A_{\beta'}:x\in A_\alpha\text{ for all }\alpha\in I\} \iff (y\in A_{\beta'} \text{ and } y\in A_\beta \text{ and } y\in A_\alpha \text{ for all } \alpha\in I)$. Using this we can see that two sets are equal from the definition of set equality.
Since we know that $\beta\in I$ the statement $(y\in A_\alpha \text{ for all } \alpha \in I)$ implies $y\in A_\beta$ thus the statements $(y\in A_\beta \text{ and } y\in A_\alpha \text{ for all } \alpha\in I)$ and $(y\in A_\alpha\text{ for all }\alpha \in A)$ are equivalent. From this and by axiom of specification we can say that $y\in \{x\in A_\beta:x\in A_\alpha\text{ for all }\alpha\in I\}\iff (y\in A_\alpha\text{ for all }\alpha\in I)$ and since this set is the definition of intersection of families of sets we have shown that $y\in\bigcap_{\alpha\in I}A_\alpha\iff(y\in A_\alpha\text{ for all }\alpha\in I)$. 
##### Exercise 3.4.10
By the axiom of pairwise union we know that $y \in ((\displaystyle\bigcup_{\alpha\in I} A_\alpha)\cup(\bigcup_{\alpha\in J} A_\alpha)) \iff (y\in(\bigcup_{\alpha\in I} A_\alpha) \text{ or } y\in (\bigcup_{\alpha\in J} A_\alpha))$ and from the axiom of union we can show that $(y\in(\displaystyle\bigcup_{\alpha\in I} A_\alpha) \text{ or } y\in (\bigcup_{\alpha\in J} A_\alpha)) \iff ((y\in A_\alpha \text{ for some } \alpha \in I) \text{ or } (y\in A_\alpha \text{ for some } \alpha \in J))$. Using the axiom of pairwise union we can say that it is equivalent to $(y\in A_\alpha \text{ for some } \alpha \in I\cup J)$ and using the axiom of union we can see that this is the same as $y\in\displaystyle\bigcup_{\alpha\in I\cup J}A_\alpha$ thus $((\displaystyle\bigcup_{\alpha\in I} A_\alpha)\cup(\bigcup_{\alpha\in J} A_\alpha)) = y\in\bigcup_{\alpha\in I\cup J}A_\alpha$
Using a similar argument we can show this also holds for intersections.
##### Exercise 3.4.11
By the axiom of union we know that $y\notin\bigcup_{\alpha\in I}A_\alpha\iff(y\notin A_\alpha \text{ for all } \alpha\in I)$ thus $y\in(X\setminus\bigcup_{\alpha\in I})\iff (y\in X\text{ and }(y\notin A_\alpha \text{ for all } \alpha\in I))$ by the definition of set difference. By its definition we know that $y \in\bigcap_{\alpha\in I}(X\setminus A_\alpha) \iff (y\in (X\setminus A_\alpha \text{ for all }\alpha\in I))$ and using the definition of set difference we can see that $(y\in (X\setminus A_\alpha \text{ for all }\alpha\in I)\iff ((y\in X\text{ and }y\notin A_\alpha) \text{ for all } \alpha\in I)$ and since $X$ is not bound to $\alpha$ we can rewrite this as $(y\in X\text{ and }(y\notin A_\alpha \text{ for all } \alpha\in I))$ completing the proof.
Using a similar argument we can see that this also holds for the other case.
