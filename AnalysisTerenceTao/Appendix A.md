##### A.1.1:
$X \iff Y$
##### A.1.2:
Exactly one of X or Y is true.
##### A.1.3
Yes. We know that when X is true, then Y is true so we only need to show that when Y is true, X is also true. We know that when X is false Y is also false thus Y cannot be true when X is false. This implies that when Y is true, X must also be true. $\square$    
or
We know that $X \implies Y$ and $X' \implies Y'$. We need to show that $Y \implies X$. $(X' \implies Y') \iff (Y \implies X)$  $\square$   
##### A.1.4
No. We already know that when X is true, then Y is true, but we also need to show that when Y is true X is true. We know that when Y is false X is false but this does not imply when Y is true X is also true. When Y is true X can be false or true without contradicting any of the statements given by the problem. 
##### A.1.5
Yes. We only need to show X and Z are logically equivalent to show that all of them are logically equivalent. When X is true Y is true and when Y is true Z is also true thus when X is true Z must also be true. By applying the same logic we can show that when Z is true X is also true. $\square$ 
##### A.1.6
Yes. We know that when X is true Y is true and when Y is true Z is true thus when X is true Z is true. We also know that when Z is true X is true so X and Z are logically equivalent. We can use the logic to show that all of them are logically equivalent. $\square$

##### A.5.1
- False. Your opponent gives you number $x$ and $y$. You are trying to make $y^2=x$ but because you cannot control anything you can't win.
- False. You first choose a number $x$ after that your opponent chooses a number $y$. You need to choose such $x$ that whatever your opponent chooses it needs to satisfy $y^2 = x$. It is trivial to choose a number that makes the statement false.
- True. You choose a number $x$ and $y$ such that $y^2 = x$. It is trivial to choose such $x$ and $y$.
- True. Your opponent chooses a $y$ and then you choose an $x$ to make $y^2 = x$ true. Whatever your opponent chooses you can just choose the square of that number for the $x$.
- False. You choose $y$ and then your opponent chooses $x$. You are trying to make $y^2 = x$. your opponent can trivially choose an $x$ to make the statement false.
###### A.7.1
$a + d = a + d$ from reflexive axiom
since we know that $a = b$ and $c = d$ we can substitute the variables on the right hand side with their equivalent variables:
$a + d = b + c$ thus concluding the proof $\square$
